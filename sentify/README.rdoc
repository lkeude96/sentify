# sentify
Sentify is a recommendation engine where Code2040 Fellows can input their emotional state and retrieve a song selection based on input from our trained data set and input from other code2040 fellows. 

# History
As code2040 fellows we are black and latino computer science students working in top tier technology companies in large cities around the US. We are marginalized in most of the spaces we enter and have to find coping mechanisms to deal with our emotions. We found that music is a great way to deal with and process our feelings but there are a lot of issues with the recommendation engines currently available.

+ Pandora recommends songs based on likeliness to other songs, based on the genre only but not sentiment
+ Spotify has more undergound artists but not a very good categorization algorithm for emotions and finding songs based on how you feel
+ Given that we are all building software and working in technology we have unique experience which we would like playlists for so we thought to even build categorizations on experiences
    + stuck debugging
    + driving home after a long day of work
    + cooking dinner
    + dealing with stress
    + being a first generation welath builder
    + communicating effectivelhy with other people who are not marginalized
    + processing the emotions which we feel and putting those feelings into words and experiences
